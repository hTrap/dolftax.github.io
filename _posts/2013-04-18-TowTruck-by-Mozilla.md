When a user comes to your site, they'll be able to activate the TowTruck tool and send a link to a friend to start collaborating on the web site.

TowTruck has collaboration features like cursor-mirroring (allowing you to see your friend's cursor on the screen in real time), collaboratively editing forms and text, browsing through the site, and both text and real-time voice chat.
